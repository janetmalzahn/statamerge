# statamerge

<!-- badges: start -->

statamerge is a dplyr wrapper designed to add the functionality from statamerges to dplyr merges. Specifically, it checks for uniqueness, adds a source "merge code" to show whether an observation was matched or not, and coalesces variables from the master and using with the same name (keeping master if there is a conflict).

## Installation

You can install the development version of statamerge from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("janetmalzahn/statamerge")
```

## Why use statamerge?
Statamerge is particularly useful for those learning R with a background in Stata. However, Stata's merges have plenty of useful features for those frequently working with merged datasets:
1. `statamerge` checks for uniqueness to ensure the dataset matches expectations. A 1:1 merge checks for uniqueness in each dataset to ensure that each observation in the master can will only be matched to a (maximum) of one observation in using. A 1:m or m:1 checks for uniqueness in either the master (m:1) or the using (1:m) datasets. This ensures that the merged dataset will have no more observations than the non-unique dataset. 
2. `statamerge` includes a code for whether an observation was matched, unmatched from the master dataset, or unmatched from the using. With current dplyr merges, there is no simple way to distinguish items that were matched from items that were not, or which dataset unamtched observations came from. `statamerge` outputs a dataset with a merge code that is 1 if the observation was unmatched from the master, 2 if the observation was unmatched from using, or 3 if the observation was merged. 

## Example

statamerge uses language from stata to refer to datasets. The first dataset input to statamerge is the "master" dataset and the second is the "using" dataset. 

```{r example}
library(statamerge)
# make datasets
merge1 <- dplyr::tibble(band = c("Big Thief", "Los Campesinos!", "Spoon", "Remi Wolf"),
                       type = c("band", "band", "band", "singer"),
                       genre = c("folk", "twee", "indie", "funk"))
merge2 <- dplyr::tibble(song = c("Songs About Your Girlfriend", "Do You", "Michael", "Jesus Etc"), band = c("Los Campesinos!", "Spoon", "Remi Wolf", "Wilco"), type = c("banger", "jam", "banger", "jam"))

merge3 <- dplyr::tibble(song = c("Songs About Your Girlfriend", "Do You", "Michael", "Jesus Etc", "The Underdog"),
                       band = c("Los Campesinos!", "Spoon", "Remi Wolf", "Wilco", "Spoon"),
                       type = c("banger", "jam", "banger", "jam", "banger"))

# one to one merge
statamerge(merge1, merge2, mergetype = "1:1", merge_vars = "band")
```

```{r 1:m example}
# stata merge 1:m
statamerge(merge1, merge3, mergetype = "1:m", merge_vars = "band")
```

```{r m:1 example}
# stata merge 1:m
statamerge(merge3, merge1, mergetype = "m:1", merge_vars = "band")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
